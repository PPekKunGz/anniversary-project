Happy 4 Month Anniversary! ❤️

Since that magical first date on April 11th, 2025, every moment with you has been absolutely precious. These past four months have been filled with so much joy, laughter, and beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.

You make my heart smile in ways I never knew possible. Your love brightens my days and makes everything better. I love how we can be silly together, support each other, and just be ourselves when we're together.

Thank you for all the wonderful moments we've shared - from our first nervous hello to where we are now. I'm so grateful to have you in my life and I look forward to creating many more special memories together.

Here's to us and our journey of love! 🥂

With all my love,
Kittiphat P.

P.S. You mean the world to me! 💕
